# Mobile Phone Book with React, Node.js, and MySQL (Dockerized)

## Project Description
The "Mobile Phone Book with React, Node.js, and MySQL" project is a full-stack application demonstrating a basic phone book system. It includes a frontend built with React, a backend using Node.js, and a MySQL database to store phone book contacts. The project is containerized using Docker, allowing easy setup and deployment. The backend exposes an API to interact with the phone book data, and the frontend communicates with the backend to display the list of contacts.
